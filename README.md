I have developed a site which can help people who are sitting in their homes and suffering from many diseases. 
There are mainly 3 roles (Admin, Dietician, and Yoga Expert). Users can ask questions and can do Yoga by sitting at home. User can also directly interact with dietician or Yoga Expert through chat.
Admin panel will have the feature to see the total number of users and can also see the growth of his website. Admin can register the Dietician and Yoga Expert.
